# Welcome Message for Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

We're going to build a simple program that implements only the very first thing a complete Tic Tac Toe program would require, simply greeting the player with a welcome message.

## Objectives

1. Read the output from running `learn`.
2. Use `puts` in `lib/welcome.rb` to print "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!"
3. Have your tests pass locally by running `learn`.
4. Submit your solution.

## Instructions

1. Run `learn`
2. Read output.
3. Code solution in `lib/welcome.rb`
4. Run `learn`
5. Read output.
6. If still broken, repeat 3-5
7. If passing, submit with `learn submit`
